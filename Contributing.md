# Contributing to SAMS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

We use the **GitHub Flow** approach for all contributions. Please follow these steps:

## GitHub Flow Steps

1. **Fork the Repository**  
    Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page to create your own copy.

2. **Clone Your Fork**  
    Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone 
    ```

3. **Create a Branch**  
    Make sure you are branching from `devel`. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
    ```
    git checkout devel
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```

4. **Make Changes**  
    Make your changes locally. Commit early and often:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Describe your changes"
    ```

5. **Push to GitHub**  
    Push your branch to your forked repository:
    ```
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```

6. **Open a Pull Request**  
    Go to the original repository and open a Pull Request from your branch. Describe your changes and reference any related issues.

7. **Review and Merge**  
    Your Pull Request will be reviewed. Please respond to feedback and make any requested changes. Once approved, it will be merged.

## Notes

- Always branch from `devel`.
- Keep your branch up to date with `devel` by merging or rebasing as needed.
- Write clear commit messages and Pull Request descriptions.

Thank you for helping improve SAMS-Harness!
